        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          ACS 5-year estimates from 2010 and 2023 were joined to NTA boundaries.
          Change was calculated as the difference between time periods.

        <h2>Neighborhood Focus</h2>
        <p>
          Three neighborhoods were selected to illustrate how citywide
          trends manifest at the local level.
