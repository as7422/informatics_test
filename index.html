    <h2>digital platforms & the city</h2>
    <p>digital platforms are increasingly contributing to everyday urban experiences
    
    </p>
    <p>social media is altering how society and the built environment are perceived
    
    </p>
    <p>
      tiktok in particular positions videos that fit certain narratives and visual identities
      to go viral easily, altering how people engage with the city

  <!-- panel 3: background continued -->
  <section class="panel">
    <p>
      digital platforms traditionally provide services like food delivery, navigation,
      ride-hailing, short-term rentals…
      
    </p>
    <p>
      these platforms produce social relations, symbolic hierarchies, modes of visibility,
      and ways of inhabiting a place. user-led content driven platforms employ locational
      user data in the form of reviews, images, and descriptions as method for commodifying
      urban place and transforming the fabric of city life.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      through these elements, they are contributing to the increasing digitization and
      mediatization of the city. this constructs the symbolic economy of place, which refers
      to the production of space and symbols through culture.

  <!-- panel 4: platform gentrification -->
  <section class="panel">
    <h2>platform gentrification</h2>
    <h3>reconfiguring traditional forms of gentrification</h3>
    <p>
      from the construction of the symbolic economy of place, certain neighborhoods can
      become objects of desire in online spaces through videos, images, or posts that are
      circulated and reproduced online. defining and increasing (or decreasing) the
      desirability of a place online can change the value of a location, providing a means
      of increasing gentrification of a certain location.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      this process is being understood as platform gentrification, which suggests that
      digital landscapes are producing spatial inequalities in the city, and are potentially
      incentivizing changes to investments in different locations.

      using the 5-year acs data for 2023 and 2010, ntas were evaluated for the following

      neighborhood hotspots)
