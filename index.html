    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      ACS 5-year estimates from 2010 and 2023 were joined to NTA boundaries.
      Change was calculated as the difference between time periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      NTAs were selected as the unit of analysis to balance neighborhood
      specificity and data stability.
