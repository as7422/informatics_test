      digital platforms traditionally provide services like food delivery, navigation,
      ride-hailing, short-term rentals…
    </p>
    <p>
      these platforms produce social relations, symbolic hierarchies, modes of visibility,
      and ways of inhabiting a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      through these elements, they are contributing to the increasing digitization and
      mediatization of the city.
